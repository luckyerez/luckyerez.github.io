I obtained a Master’s degree  from the School of Software at Zhejiang University, and I have three years of work experience in product design. I previously held the position of Senior Product Manager at Alibaba.

I am interested in human-computer interaction, user-centered design, and psychology. *Here are my personal characteristics:*
   **1.Experience in product design for products with hundreds of millions of daily active users (DAU).** I have served as a product manager at Amap and Taobao, where my primary function was human-centered product design. I collaborated with developers to ensure timely product launches and iterated the products based on data feedback. This involved extensive use of participatory user research, data analysis, and other methods.
   **2.A strong motivation to integrate technology with the health sector, especially mental health.** Having been a patient myself, I underwent two years of psychological counseling. I aim to leverage potential technological means to assist more potential patients.
   **3.Strong learning capabilities.** Through diligent study, I was admitted to Zhejiang University (QS: 44) and received top 1% scholarships and honors during both my undergraduate and graduate studies.
