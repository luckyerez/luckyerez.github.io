I obtained a Master’s degree  from the School of Software at Zhejiang University, and I have three years of work experience in product design. I previously held the position of Senior Product Manager at Alibaba.

I am interested in human-computer interaction, user-centered design, and psychology.<span style="color: #6C6C6C;"> *Here are my personal characteristics:*</span>  
   <strong><span style="color: #004B97;">1.Experience in product design for products with hundreds of millions of daily active users (DAU).</span></strong> I have served as a product manager at Amap and Taobao, and have rich practical experience in product design, team collaboration, and data analysis.  
   <strong><span style="color: #004B97;">2.A strong motivation to integrate technology with the health sector, especially mental health.</span></strong> Having been a patient myself, I underwent two years of psychological counseling.
